## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.

- **Andrew Mead's [The Great Gatsby Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM) is great.** It goes through everything you need to build and launch your first site with Gatsby. You’ll build a website from scratch and learn how to get it deployed to production.
